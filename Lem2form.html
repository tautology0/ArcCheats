<h1>Lemmings 2 - saved game file format</h1>

<h2>Archimedes</h2>
<h6>Do other machines have the same format?</h6>
The file is divided into blocks of 10 - each block equates to 1 of the
save positions. Each block is &1F6 bytes long and the resulting file is
NOT word-aligned, though it is half-word aligned.<p>

For each block:
<pre>
Offset  Size    Use
0       20      The name of the position - terminated by a 0 or if it is
                full.
</pre>                

then they are divided into 12x10 blocks each of 4 bytes, starting from
offset &3A, each block is for that level of that game.<p>

The format is:

<pre>
offset  Use
------------
0       NULL
1       Number of Lemmings for this level.
2       NULL
3       Standard of success:    0 - haven't completed this.
                                1 - 3rd step
                                2 - 2nd step
                                3 - 1st step
The value for the first level is always 0
</pre>

These 12x10 words are placed by the following algorithm:
<pre>
base=(posno-1)*&1F6
offset=base+20+(tribeno*40)+((levelno-1)*4)
</pre>

the tribeno's are:
<pre>
        Classic         0
        Beach           1
        Cave            2
        Circus          3
        Egyptian        4
        Highland        5
        Medieval        6
        Outdoor         7
        Polar           8
        Shadow          9
        Space           10
        Sports          11
</pre>

eg the word for level 7 in the Polar tribe, on the second saved-game file is
at offset:
<pre>
base  =(2-1)*&1F6
      =&1F6
offset=&1F6+20+(8*40)+((7-1)*4)
      =&1F6+20+320+24
      =&1F6+&16C
      =&362  
</pre>

The final 2 bytes after al the level data (at offset &1F4) are a NULL
followed by the current tribe number. The tribe number is same as above.<p>
