Archimedes Cheat Manual

Compiled by Dave Lodge
Release: 1.05 Text/DoggySoft

This document has been compiled by me (Dave Lodge) to act as a full
compilation of all Archimedes cheats/bugs/pokes/passwords etc. I hope 
to keep it as up to date as possible, this is limited by time and money. 
Any contributions will be gratefully accepted. The latest version of this 
document can always be received by sending me a disc and return postage (I
am only a student) to the below address. A text only version is available
through email. This version was done on Zap. [And was then altered by AjC
to make the tabs readable on other text editors.]

I make no guarantee to the correctness of any cheats/bugs/pokes/passwords
etc contained in this document, most have been taken out of magazines or
the programs themselves. If you have any cheats not included in this
document I would be very grateful if you could send them to me ;) If you
include a disc I will send you the latest version of this manual. Or if you
can tell me how to get some of the mentioned cheats working, where I can't
get a cheat to work I have indicated it. I haven't been able to check all
cheats (I don't have all the games!)

I will not accept Games Wizard codes for pokes - just send me the poke...

I would like to thank all the people who have contributed to this 
document, by sending cheats into magazines or to BBSs: Ian Jeffray, The Fox,
Adam Case, James Hunter, The Hac-man, The Hac-man (part II) the ppl
responsible for the Archimedes World cheat page, the ppl responsible for the
Acorn User cheat page (I can't remember their names) and anyone else who I
have gained a cheat off, especially the game authors who in their wisdom
have included cheat modes and easy-to-hack-out-passwords... I would like to
give a special thanks to DoggySoft, who have made life a lot easier with
their excellent Hacker program...

Okay? The term address is only relevant during university term time, ie 
from about 2nd week in October to about the first week in June, 
excluding bits for Chrimbo & Easter. Do not use it before/after these 
times, because if you ever received the letter back it will probably be 
very late. In case of doubt use Home address - it will eventually reach 
me...

Please note that this document is Shareware ie you can copy it but if you 
want the current version you must 'buy' it from me - the price is 1 disc, ie
send 2 discs to me and I will return 1 of the discs with the current ACM on
it.

This edition of the ACM has been produced in conjunction with 
DoggySoft especially to be given away with their excellent product ('The 
Hacker') For this version I would like to thank Andrew Clover for the cheats
which he has given me...

This is a Riscy Developments/Doggysoft production

Mode    - Start a game and then pause it (by pressing COPY) you should see
the word 'PAUSED' on the screen. Now press the 'L', 'V', '4', '2' & '6' (The
planet in Alien!) keys simultaneously. The border around the word 'PAUSED'
will change from White to Blue. Now, in the cheat mode you can use the
following keys to do the following effects:
        Key        Effect
        F5         Toggle infinite energy**
        F6         Toggle invincibility**
        F7         Infinite lives**
        F8         Skip to next screen**
        F9         Toggle hidden object pointer**
        F10        Save screen to disc
        F11        Toggle Slow Motion**
        F12        Skip to next level**

*The weapon word consists of a word with bits set for each weapon, the bits
are taken from the order of the weapons on the screen, ie bit 0 is the
staff, bit 1 is the Nunchakas etc
**This effect will only happen when the game is paused...

The Lost Temple
Cheat mode      - Before running the game press F12 and type in the
following:
                *MemoryA 0 1
and press return to return to the desktop, then run the game as normal, the
words 'Cheat Mode On' should appear on the top right hand corner of the
screen, you can now access any level from 1 to 10, and (I think) you have
extra energy.
